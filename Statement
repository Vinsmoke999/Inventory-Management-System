Problem Statement
Small-scale shop owners and inventory managers require a simple, reliable, and accessible tool to keep track of their stock levels, item details, and manage inventory movements. The current manual processes are prone to errors and lack real-time visibility into available quantities, leading to potential stockouts or overstocking. This project aims to solve this by creating a basic digital inventory management system.


Scope of the Project
The project implements a Console-Based Inventory Management System that allows the user to perform basic inventory operations on items (referred to as "Saman").

The system's scope includes:


Data Persistence: Loading inventory data from and saving it to a plain text file (Saman.txt).


Item Management: Adding new items to the inventory, with unique ID validation.


Stock Monitoring: Displaying a list of all items with their ID, name, price, and current quantity.


Stock Updates: Allowing the user to update the stock quantity of an existing item (both adding and selling stock).


User Interface: Providing a simple text-based menu for interacting with the system.

Target Users
The primary target users for this system are:


Small Business Owners: Individuals running small shops or kiosks that need a simple way to manage their physical goods.


Inventory Clerks: Personnel responsible for basic stock entry and updating in a small organization.


Students/Beginners: Users needing a straightforward, console-based tool for practicing basic inventory and data handling operations.

High-Level Features
The Inventory Management System provides the following high-level features:


View Inventory: Display all current items and their details (ID, Name, Price, Quantity).


Add Item: Create a new inventory record with a unique ID, name, price, and initial quantity (a CRUD operation).


Update Stock: Increase (Add Stock) or Decrease (Sell Stock) the quantity of an item using its unique ID (a CRUD operation).


Data Persistence: Automatically load and save inventory data to a file upon start and after updates.


Error Handling: Include basic checks for existing IDs when adding new items and for insufficient stock when selling (an Error handling strategy)
